    - title: Programming
      text: You will learn socket programming, create packet headers, write your own protocols, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The programming will be in Python or C++/C. If you want to use another language, discuss it with me beforehand.
      icon: doc-sync
    - title: Assignments and Late Policies
      text: We will have four programming assignments in addition to the usual homeworks. You get two no-penalty, no-questions asked late submissions, one for the programming assignments, and one for the homeworks. But use them wisely, subsequent late submissions will have a 30% deduction from your score, and there will be no exceptions (other than documented emergencies).
